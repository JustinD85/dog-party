#Dog-Party

##Synopsis
It’s a dog party! The reality is, as a frontend developer, you’re going to be building out a lot of the UI on websites and apps. This can be a lot of fun, and you definitely want to get good at it! One of the beginning pieces is using semantic html and writing clean CSS. Similar to what you might do in a job, you’ve got a comp and need to build it out.

Dog Party

#### Specifications

Using your terminal, create a directory called dog-party
Inside of your dog-party directory, create a sub-directory called images
Also create two files called index.html and styles.css
You will also need to download the assets and insert them into your images directory
Note: Do not use CSS flex-box or grid for this project (If you don’t know what this is, no worries. You’ll learn more about this in the future!)

Next Steps
Start out focusing on the HTML using semantic tags and creating a clean structure.
Then focus on styling your site like a boss :smirk:
Finally, create a README.md file making sure to include the comp as well as a picture of your site
Submission Details
After you have completed your project and are happy with it, we want you to push it up to GitHub. You’ll learn more about Git & GitHub soon, but essentially, it’s a service/website that allows developers(you) to host your code/sites. Pretty cool right!?

Add a public key to your github account
In order to push up your work to GitHub, you’ll need to generate an SSH key. SSH keys are a way to identify trusted computers without involving passwords. You can generate an SSH key and add the public key to your GitHub account by following the procedures outlined in this tutorial from GitHub. This video will walk you through the process and likely save you time.

Setting up Repository on GitHub and Pushing up
Create a new repository on GitHub by clicking that green button on the home page that says New Repository
Enter in a relevant name for this project (i.e. Dog Party)
Do NOT initialize the repository with a README. You have already created one locally on your computer.
Leave it set as public because you want to others to see your work and then click Create Repository!
Follow the steps on the next page and enter each command into your terminal
Once you see your code up in your repository, go to Settings and publish your site on GitHub pages!
Finally, place your links in the appropriate tab of the Submission Sheet
Example Steps for Part 5
git init inside of your dog-party directory
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin git@github.com:Kalikoze/Dog-Party.git
git push -u origin master
